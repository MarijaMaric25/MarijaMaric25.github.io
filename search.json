    "text": "Meta-analyses of published single-case research into youth treatments are conducted for various youth problems such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, externalizing problems, OCD, eating disorders and problems. A strength of single-case research is that it can assess the effect for specific cases, for specific treatments, in specific contexts. Despite this idiosyncracity, we expect that there is some communality, e.g., if a certain effect was found effective for some cases, it may be expected effective for other cases as well. With meta-analyses of single-case studies we evaluate the overall effect of treatments, individual variability in treatment effects and moderators of individual treatment outcomes.  \n So far, we have published a SCED meta-analysis on internalizing problems, and the one on externalizing problems is accepted for publication.

    "text": "We are a team of researchers and scientist-practitioners dedicated to advancing the science and practice of treatments for youth psychopathology. Despite significant progress in understanding the efficacy and effectiveness of youth treatments, several critical questions remain: Why do some youths not improve after treatment? How can treatments be individually tailored and their effects investigated? What are the mediators responsible for these effects? How can we bridge the gap between science and practice to create more evidence-based clinical practice for youth? And how can we enhance the reach and impact of personalized healthcare? To address these questions, we implement single-case experimental design methods and train scientist-practitioners to do the same. Single-case studies allow for the investigation of treatment effects within individual clients, in specific contexts, providing insights into personalized therapeutic approaches and working mechanisms. By focusing on individual treatment effects and training practitioners in single-case methodologies, our work bridges the gap between science and practice. This approach enhances the reach and impact of personalized healthcare, paving the way for more effective therapeutic interventions that improve the mental health and well-being of children, adolescents, and families.\n\n\nWe are thankful to Max Paulus from the UvA Research Lab and dog Lucky for helping us create these pages! Dutch version of the website follows soon.\n\n\nMarija Maric, Ph.D.\n\nMarija Maric, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor at the University of Amsterdam in the Department of Child Development and Education.
