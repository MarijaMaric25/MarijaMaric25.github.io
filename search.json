    "text": "In youth intervention research field, single-case experimental designs (SCEDs) are already frequently implemented to evaluate treatment effectiveness. While it is really important to investigate these within-person treatment effects, these studies often include one to ten cases. As a consequence, the reach and impact of these studies remain limited. The strength of single-case research is, of course, that it can assess the effects for specific clients, specific treatments, and in specific contexts. Despite this idiosyncracity, we expect that there is some communality, e.g., if a certain effect was found effective for some cases, it may be expected effective for other cases as well. Led by this idea, and to increase the impact of single-case research and aggregate knowledge, we conduct a serie of meta-analyses of single-case research for different youth psychopathologies, using innovative data science and data-analysis methods.\n So far, we published a SCED meta-analysis on internalizing problems, and the one on the externalizing problems is under review.

    "text": "About us\nWe are a team of researchers and scientist-practicioners passionate about improving the science and practice of treatments for youth psychopathology. While tremendous amount of progress has been made with regard to the knowledge on the efficacy and effectiveness of youth treatments in the past decades, some questions still remain unresolved: Why don’t some youths improve after treatment? Hoe can we individually tailor treatments for youths and investigate effects? What are the working mechanisms (mediators) responsible for the effects? How can we personalize, and how can we really bridge the gap between science and practice, and create more evidence-based youth clinical practice? To answer these and similar questions we implement single-case experimental design methods, and we train scientist-practicioners in becoming capable to do so as well. Take a look at our webpage.\n We are forever thankful to Max Paulus from the UvA Research Lab, Lana (13 y.o.), and dog Lucky (5 y.o.) for helping us create these pages!\nMarija Maric, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor at the University of Amsterdam, department of Child Development and Education. After finishing MA in Clinical Psychology at Leiden University, she conducted a PhD program during which she investigated mediators and moderators of treatment outcomes for internalizing disorders and school refusal in children, adolescents, and their families. Hereafter she moved to the University of Amsterdam and developed a research line involving using single-case experimental design methods to study effectiveness, mediators and moderators of youth interventions. Marija received her cognitive behavioral therapist’s degree in 2017. She has over 20 years of teaching and supervising experience in bachelor, (research) master and postgraduate education.

    "text": "The aims of this project are two-fold. The first one is to rate existing single-case research on youth interventions for quality, using tools that assess internal and external validity of a study. We have already done that for the study included in our two recent meta-analyses on internalizing and externalizing problems.\nThe second aim is to design and evaluate a new tool for rating of the quality of single-case research in youth.
