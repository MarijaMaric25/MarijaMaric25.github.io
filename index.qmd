<p style="text-align: center">We are a team of researchers and scientist-practitioners dedicated to advancing the science and practice of treatments for youth psychopathology. Despite significant progress in understanding the efficacy and effectiveness of youth treatments, several critical questions remain: Why do some youths not improve after treatment? How can treatments be individually tailored and their effects investigated? What are the mediators responsible for these effects? How can we bridge the gap between science and practice to create more evidence-based clinical practice for youth? And how can we enhance the reach and impact of personalized healthcare? To address these questions, we implement single-case experimental design methods and train scientist-practitioners to do the same. Single-case studies allow for the investigation of treatment effects within individual clients, in specific contexts, providing insights into personalized therapeutic approaches and working mechanisms. By focusing on individual treatment effects and training practitioners in single-case methodologies, our work bridges the gap between science and practice. This approach enhances the reach and impact of personalized healthcare, paving the way for more effective therapeutic interventions that improve the mental health and well-being of children, adolescents, and families.</p><p style="text-align: center"><em>We are thankful to Max Paulus from the UvA Research Lab and dog Lucky for helping us create these pages!&nbsp;Dutch version of the website follows soon.</em></p>

Marija Maric, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor at the University of Amsterdam in the Department of Child Development and Education. She completed her MA in Clinical Psychology at Leiden University and pursued a Ph.D. in Clinical Developmental Psychology investigating mediators and moderators of treatment outcomes for internalizing disorders and school refusal in children, adolescents, and their families. At the University of Amsterdam, she developed a research line focused on using single-case experimental design methods to study the effectiveness, mediators, and moderators of youth interventions. Marija received her cognitive behavioral therapistâ€™s degree in 2017 and has over 20 years of experience in teaching and supervising at the bachelor, (research) master, and postgraduate levels. She is also skilled in leadership and management.
