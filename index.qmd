subtitle: "For studying within-person treatment effects using Single-Case
  Experimental Designs We are a team of researchers and scientist-practitioners
  dedicated to advancing the science and practice of treatments for youth
  psychopathology. Despite significant progress in understanding the efficacy
  and effectiveness of youth treatments, several critical questions remain: Why
  do some youths not improve after treatment? How can treatments be individually
  tailored and their effects investigated? What are the mediators responsible
  for these effects? How can we bridge the gap between science and practice to
  create more evidence-based clinical practice for youth? And how can we enhance
  the reach and impact of personalized healthcare? To address these questions,
  we implement single-case experimental design methods and train
  scientist-practitioners to do the same. Single-case studies allow for the
  investigation of treatment effects within individual clients, in specific
  contexts, providing insights into personalized therapeutic approaches and
  working mechanisms. By focusing on individual treatment effects and training
  practitioners in single-case methodologies, our work bridges the gap between
  science and practice. This approach enhances the reach and impact of
  personalized healthcare, paving the way for more effective therapeutic
  interventions that improve the mental health and well-being of children,
  adolescents, and families."
