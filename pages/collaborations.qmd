We strongly believe that, to achieve high impact youth intervention research, rigorous methodology and data science is necessary. Therefore, we collaborate happily and successfully with colleagues specialized in single-case data-analysis, and in data collection, preparation, and quality of the data. Recent initiatives include collaborations with AI-scientists.
