**August 31st, 2025, SCED data entry tool version 1.0 finalized!**

In the past year together with colleagues from Data Science Center (UvA) and software engineers from UvA Library, we worked on a user-friendly tool that will help us extract single-case data in a more efficient way and will enhance accuracy of extraction. We are very happy to be using this tool in the upcoming year with our next MetaSCED projects!
