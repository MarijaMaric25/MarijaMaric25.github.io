title: Quality of SCEDs
---
The aims of this project are two-fold. The first one is to rate existing single-case research on youth interventions for quality, using tools that assess internal and external validity of a study. We have already done that for the study included in our two recent meta-analyses on internalizing and externalizing problems. The second aim is to design and evaluate a new tool for rating the quality of single-case research in youth. More info follows soon! 

Already the results about the quality of single-case research in internalizing and externalizing problems in youth can be found here:
