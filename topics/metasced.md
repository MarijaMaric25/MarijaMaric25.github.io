Meta-analyses of published single-case research into youth treatments are conducted for various youth problems such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, externalizing problems, OCD, eating disorders and problems. A strength of single-case research is that it can assess the effect for specific cases, for specific treatments, in specific contexts. Despite this idiosyncracity, we expect that there is some communality, e.g., if a certain effect was found effective for some cases, it may be expected effective for other cases as well. With meta-analyses of single-case studies we evaluate the overall effect of treatments, individual variability in treatment effects and moderators of individual treatment outcomes.  

 So far, we have published a SCED meta-analysis on internalizing problems, and the one on externalizing problems is accepted for publication. Keep an eye on our website to learn which youth psychopathology area we are currently busy with!
