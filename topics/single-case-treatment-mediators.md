title: Single-Case Treatment Mediators
---
What happens when we unify single-case research methodology and statistical mediation analyses? We are then able to study individual treatment mediators or mechanisms responsible for changes in therapy outcomes. The innovative aim of this research project is to develop novel concepts and methods to study individual treatment mediators in youth with mental health problems. Interdisciplinary (pedagogics/psychology and methodology), multi-method (qualitative and quantitative) and (inter)national approach is implemented with clinical partners and experience experts’ contribution.
