The innovative aim of the intended research project is to develop novel concept and methods to study individual treatment mediators in youth with mental health problems, by unifying single-case research methodology and statistical mediation analysis. Interdisciplinary (pedagogics/psychology and methodology), multi-method (qualitative and quantitative) and (inter)national approach is implemented with clinical partners and experience experts’ contribution.
